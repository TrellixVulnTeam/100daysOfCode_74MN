# 100daysOfCode

## 1 - Arithmetic Formatter

#### Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.

## 2 - Time Calculator

#### Write a function named "add_time" that can add a duration to a start time and return the result.

## 3 - Budget App

#### Create a "Category" class that can be used to create different budget categories.

## 4 - Polygon Area Calculator

#### In this project you will use object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.

## 5 - Probability Calculator

#### Write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.

## 6 - Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

#### Create a function that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

## 7 - Demographic Data Analyzer

#### In this challenge you must analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

## 8 - Medical Data Visualizer

#### In this project, you will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas.

## 9 - Page View Time Series Visualizer

#### For this project you will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

## 10 - Sea Level Predictor

#### In this project, you will analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. You will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
